# Problem Statement

Imagine you are building a chat application in which a user can chat with any other user, provided they are both connected. For a user to initiate the chat, it is always helpful if we show who all are online.

In this assignment, let's design a system that indicates who all are online at the moment. The micro-problem statement is as simple as answering the question - Given a user, return if he/she is online or not.
